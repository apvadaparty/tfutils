# How to generate the docs

First, install following packages using pip: `sphinx`, `sphinx-autobuild`, `sphinx_rtd_theme`.

Then go to `./build` folder, run `make html` to generate the documents.
You can view the generated documents through opening `./build/html/index.html`.

Look at `./source/index.rst` to learn about how to modify it.
